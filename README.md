PostgreSQL: Inserting data
Instructions
In this practice problem, you will write queries to insert new data into two existing tables: artists and artworks. You can view the files to see what fields they contain.

Only one query should be written per file. Carefully check your syntax if you encounter errors. In particular, the names of the tables are very important.

Artist queries
For each of the following files, create a query as described.

insert-artist.sql: Insert a single row into the table with the following information:

first_name: Kehinde
last_name: Wiley
birthday: 1977-02-28
is_alive: true

insert-multiple-artists.sql: Insert three artists in a single query to the artists table in this file. You may include whichever artists you like, but all fields should be filled for each one.

Artwork queries
There is only one query to complete in the artworks/ folder.

insert-artwork.sql: Insert a single row into the table with the following information. Note that the description field should be left empty.
name: Algorna Study II
medium: oil on paper
